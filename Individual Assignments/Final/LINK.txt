There were some problems with this exam.

I had Set C. For set C you gave us an API that doesn't support https connections but then told us that we had to use https on Heroku. That doesn't work.

My code is uploaded to Heroku and as far as I know works other than this. There is just no way to pull data from the API I was given on Heroku. Heroku doesn't support http connections,
the API I was given doesn't support https connections.

So, my code is all there, but it doesn't work on Heroku. It works fine on local.

Inside my zip, you will see a folder with screenshots of each page. If you run the code, it works perfectly, but I was told in the Zoom help call to just take screenshots and submit those.

The fact that this is a problem I have to experience on the FINAL EXAM for a class is unacceptable.
I spend roughly 2-hours trying to troubleshoot this on top of the time it took me to write the FULLY FUNCTIONING CODE.

These concerns are not alleviated by the fact that you eventually changed the instructions. The fact that you posted instructions you haven't fully tested on a final exam is unacceptable.

Anyways, Here's a link to my (partially working) Heroku - https://csci-3308-final-fall2020.herokuapp.com/
